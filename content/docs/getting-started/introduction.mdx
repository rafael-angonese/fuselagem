## How is Fuselagem docs is builded?

- **TailwindCSS**:

  <div className="text-default-500">
    Tailwind CSS is a CSS Framework that provides atomic CSS classes to help you style components,
    leaving you to handle lots of other things like accessibility, component composition, keyboard
    navigation, style overrides, etc.
  </div>

- **NextUI**:
  <div className="text-default-500">
    NextUI is a UI library for React that combines the power of TailwindCSS with React Aria to
    provide complete components (logic and styles) for building accessible and customizable user
    interfaces. Since NextUI uses TailwindCSS as its style engine, you can use all TailwindCSS
    classes within your NextUI components, ensuring optimal compiled CSS size.
