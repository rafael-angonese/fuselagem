# Introduction

## How is Fuselagem UI is builded?

- **TailwindCSS**:

  <div className="text-default-500">
    Tailwind CSS is a CSS Framework that provides atomic CSS classes to help you
    style components, leaving you to handle lots of other things like
    accessibility, component composition, keyboard navigation, style overrides,
    etc.
  </div>

- **Framer Motion**:

  <div className="text-default-500">
    Framer Motion is a powerful animation library for React that simplifies the
    process of creating complex animations declaratively. It offers an intuitive
    API to handle animations and transitions without manually dealing with CSS
    keyframes. Framer Motion also provides advanced features like gestures
    (drag, tap, hover), layout animations, and physics-based animations, making
    it easy to build highly interactive and fluid UIs.
  </div>

- **Typescript**:
    <div className="text-default-500">
      TypeScript, on the other hand, is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript
      that adds static type checking. It helps developers catch errors during
      development, making the codebase more predictable and robust. In the
      context of a UI component library, TypeScript ensures that components have
      well-defined props and states, improving code quality, refactoring
      capabilities, and providing a better development experience through
      enhanced IDE support.
    </div>
