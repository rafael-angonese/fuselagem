## Disable Animations Globally

NextUI components are animated by default and can be disabled by setting the prop `disableAnimation` individually. Since v2.4.0, you can globally disable the animation by setting `disableAnimation` to `NextUIProvider`.

```tsx
"use client";

import {type ReactNode} from "react";
import {NextUIProvider} from "@nextui-org/react";

export function AppProvider(props: AppProviderProps) {
  const {children, className} = props;

  return (
    <NextUIProvider className={className} disableAnimation>
      {children}
    </NextUIProvider>
  );
}

interface AppProviderProps {
  children: ReactNode;
  className?: string;
}
```

## API Improvements

### disableRipple

By default, there is a ripple effect on press in Button and Card component and can be disabled by setting the prop `disableRipple` individually. Since v2.4.0, it can be disabled globally by setting `disableRipple` to `NextUIProvider`.

```tsx
"use client";

import {type ReactNode} from "react";
import {NextUIProvider} from "@nextui-org/react";

export function AppProvider(props: AppProviderProps) {
  const {children, className} = props;

  return (
    <NextUIProvider className={className} disableRipple>
      {children}
    </NextUIProvider>
  );
}

interface AppProviderProps {
  children: ReactNode;
  className?: string;
}
```

### skipFramerMotionAnimations

We can control whether `framer-motion` animations are skipped within the application. This property is automatically enabled (`true`) when the `disableAnimation` prop is set to `true`, effectively skipping all `framer-motion` animations. To retain `framer-motion` animations while using the `disableAnimation` prop for other purposes, set this to `false`. However, note that animations in NextUI Components are still omitted if the `disableAnimation` prop is `true`.

```tsx
"use client";

import {type ReactNode} from "react";
import {NextUIProvider} from "@nextui-org/react";

export function AppProvider(props: AppProviderProps) {
  const {children, className} = props;

  return (
    <NextUIProvider className={className} skipFramerMotionAnimations>
      {children}
    </NextUIProvider>
  );
}

interface AppProviderProps {
  children: ReactNode;
  className?: string;
}
```

### validationBehavior

We can set `validationBehavior` to either `native` or `aria` to control whether to use native HTML form validation to prevent form submission when the value is missing or invalid, or mark the field as required or invalid via ARIA. If it is not specified, `aria` will be used by default.

```tsx
"use client";

import {type ReactNode} from "react";
import {NextUIProvider} from "@nextui-org/react";

export function AppProvider(props: AppProviderProps) {
  const {children, className} = props;

  return (
    <NextUIProvider className={className} validationBehavior="native">
      {children}
    </NextUIProvider>
  );
}

interface AppProviderProps {
  children: ReactNode;
  className?: string;
}
```

## CLI Improvements

### Refactor Init Flow View

We've refactored the init flow view to provide a better user experience.

The latest flow view output:

```bash
‚îå  Create a new project
‚îÇ
‚óá  Select a template (Enter to select)
‚îÇ  ‚óè App (A Next.js 14 with app directory template pre-configured with NextUI (v2) and Tailwind CSS.)
‚îÇ  ‚óã Pages (A Next.js 14 with pages directory template pre-configured with NextUI (v2) and Tailwind CSS.)
‚îÇ  ‚óã Vite (A Vite template pre-configured with NextUI (v2) and Tailwind CSS.)
‚îÇ
‚óá  New project name (Enter to skip with default name)
‚îÇ  my-nextui-app
‚îÇ

‚îÇ  cd my-nextui-app  ‚îÇ
‚îÇ  npm install       ‚îÇ
‚îÇ                    ‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ïØ
‚îÇ
‚îî  üöÄ Get started with npm run dev
```

### Add Vite Template

We've introduced a new Vite template pre-configured with NextUI v2 and TailwindCSS. The following command is to initialize a new Vite project named `my-vite-app`.

```bash
nextui init my-vite-app -t vite
```

### Package Manager Flag

We've introduced a new flag `-p` (or `--package`) to init command to allow users to choose the package manager to use for the new project. By default, `npm` is used. For example, the following command will initialize a new NextUI project with the app template named my-nextui-app using pnpm package manager.

```bash
nextui init my-nextui-app -t app -p pnpm
```

### no-cache Flag

We've introduced a new flag `--no-cache` to allow users to disable the cache. By default, the data will be cached for 30 mins after the first request. It is useful when the data is cached, and you wish to upgrade to the new version just released after the first request. In this way, you can run the following command

```bash
nextui --no-cache upgrade
```

### Upgrade Version Output

You can now run the upgrade command and see the summary version of the package you are upgrading to.

### Upgrade And Remove Select View Optimization

The disabled option(s) will be displayed in the bottom of the list.

### Doctor Command add peerDependencies check

The `doctor` command now checks for peerDependencies and displays the incorrect peerDependencies. (See [nextui-org/nextui#2954](https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui/issues/2954) for more).

## React Aria Packages Upgrades

We've upgraded and fixed React Aria packages dependencies across our components. This update focuses on enhancing accessibility, ensuring better compatibility with the latest versions of React Aria, and resolving previously reported bugs.

<Spacer y={4} />

## Breaking Changes

### Export improved `cn` utility

> If you are using it from `@nextui-org/react`, no changes are required.

The new `cn` utility exported from the `@nextui-org/theme` package includes `tailwind-merge` to avoid conflicts between tailwindcss classes overrides and includes the config for NextUI custom classes.

If you are using the `cn` utility from the `@nextui-org/system`, 

```diff-tsx
-import {cn} from "@nextui-org/system"
```

or `@nextui-org/system-rsc` package,

```diff-tsx
-import {cn} from "@nextui-org/system-rsc"
```

you need to update the import as follows:

```diff-tsx
+ import {cn} from "@nextui-org/theme"
```

<Spacer y={4} />

### Validation Behavior

Since v2.4.0, we've changed the default validation behavior to `aria` which means no native validation is applied. If you wish to use the native validation, you can set `validationBehavior` to `native` to the input components or set it to the Provider as stated above.

For those who use `validationBehavior="aria"`, `validate` will be no longer applied since it is only for native validation. Therefore, you need to switch to use `isInvalid` prop instead.

```tsx
<form onSubmit={onSubmit}>
  <Input errorMessage={formErrors?.field1} isInvalid={!!formErrors?.field1} name="field1" />
  <Button type="submit">Submit</Button>
</form>
```
